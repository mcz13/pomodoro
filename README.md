# Pomodoro
Hi guys i made a simple program for pomodoro time method.
It play sound 25 minutes after you start the work and you have a break,
it play another sound for 5 minutes later and you start work again.
You can download the jar file directly from dist folder but  startmusic.wav and break.wav must exist in C folder for music playing or you can download it as a project and change directory and music files name as whatever you want and create new things with it for example stop music button.I hope you like and enjoy with it.
